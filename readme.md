# Target Brazil E-Commerce Data Analysis (PostgreSQL Project)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes a Brazilian e-commerce dataset to generate actionable business insights.  
The analysis was performed entirely in **PostgreSQL** using SQL queries.  
It covers customer trends, sales performance, freight costs, delivery times, and payment behaviors.

Dataset consists of **8 CSV files**:
- `customers.csv`
- `orders.csv`
- `order_items.csv`
- `payments.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `sellers.csv`
- `geolocation.csv`
- `order_reviews.csv`

1) Import the dataset and do usual exploratory analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset

1.1) Data type of all columns in the "customers" table.
SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable,
  character_maximum_length
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'customers'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
 

1.2) Get the time range between which the orders were placed.
SELECT
  MIN(order_purchase_timestamp) AS first_order_ts,
  MAX(order_purchase_timestamp) AS last_order_ts,
  COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM public.orders;
 

1.3) Count the Cities & States of customers who ordered during the given period.

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_city)   AS distinct_cities,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_state)  AS distinct_states
FROM public.customers c
JOIN public.orders o
  ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
 

2) In-depth Exploration

2.1) Is there a growing trend in the no. of orders placed over the past years?

select
	extract(year from order_purchase_timestamp) as year,
	count(order_id) as total_orders
from orders
group by extract(year from order_purchase_timestamp)
order by extract(year from order_purchase_timestamp)
 

2.2) Can we see some kind of monthly seasonality in terms of the no. of orders being placed?

select
	extract(month from order_purchase_timestamp) as year,
	count(order_id) as total_orders
from orders
group by extract(month from order_purchase_timestamp)
order by extract(month from order_purchase_timestamp)
 

2.3)During what time of the day, do the Brazilian customers mostly place their orders? (Dawn, Morning, Afternoon or Night)
--0-6 hrs : Dawn
--7-12 hrs : Mornings
--13-18 hrs : Afternoon
--19-23 hrs : Night

select 
	count(case when extract (hour from order_purchase_timestamp) between 0 and 6 then 1 end) as dawn,
	count(case when extract (hour from order_purchase_timestamp) between 7 and 12 then 1 end) as mornings,
	count(case when extract (hour from order_purchase_timestamp) between 13 and 18 then 1 end) as afternoon,
	count(case when extract (hour from order_purchase_timestamp) between 19 and 23 then 1 end) as night
from orders
 

3) Evolution of E-commerce orders in the Brazil region.

3.1) Get the month on month no. of orders placed in each state.

select
	c.customer_state,
	extract(month from o.order_purchase_timestamp) as month,
	extract(year from o.order_purchase_timestamp) as year,
	count(o.order_id) as no_of_orders
from customers as c
join orders as o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
group by c.customer_state, extract(month from o.order_purchase_timestamp), extract(year from o.order_purchase_timestamp)
order by c.customer_state, extract(month from o.order_purchase_timestamp), extract(year from o.order_purchase_timestamp)
 

3.2) How are the customers distributed across all the states?

select
	customer_state,
	count(customer_id) as total_customers
from customers
group by customer_state
order by count(customer_id) desc
 

4) Impact on Economy: Analyze the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others.

4.1) Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only). You can use the "payment_value" column in the payments table to get the cost of orders.

SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) = 2017
              AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 1 AND 8
             THEN p.payment_value ELSE 0 END) AS total_2017,
    SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) = 2018
              AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 1 AND 8
             THEN p.payment_value ELSE 0 END) AS total_2018,
    (
        SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) = 2018
                  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 1 AND 8
                 THEN p.payment_value ELSE 0 END)
        -
        SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) = 2017
                  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 1 AND 8
                 THEN p.payment_value ELSE 0 END)
    ) * 100.0
    /
    NULLIF(
        SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) = 2017
                  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 1 AND 8
                 THEN p.payment_value ELSE 0 END),
        0
    ) AS pct_increase
FROM orders o
JOIN payments p ON o.order_id = p.order_id;
 

4.2) Calculate the Total & Average value of order price for each state.

select 
	distinct c.customer_state,
	round(sum(payment_value)::numeric,2) as total,
	round(avg(payment_value)::numeric,2) as avg
from orders as o
join customers as c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
join payments as p
on o.order_id=p.order_id
group by c.customer_state
 

4.3) Calculate the Total & Average value of order freight for each state.

select
	c.customer_state,
	round(sum(i.freight_value)::numeric,2) as total,
	round(avg(i.freight_value)::numeric,2) as avg
from customers as c
join orders as o
on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
join order_items as i
on o.order_id=i.order_id
group by c.customer_state
 

5) Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time.

5.1) Find the no. of days taken to deliver each order from the order‚Äôs purchase date as delivery time. Also, calculate the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order.

select 
	order_id,
	extract (days from (order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp)) as delivery_days,
	extract (days from (order_delivered_customer_date - order_estimated_delivery_date)) as delivery_days
from orders
where order_status = 'delivered'
 

5.2) Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value.

WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT
        c.customer_state,
        AVG(i.freight_value) AS avg_freight,
        'low'::text AS type
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN order_items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_state
    ORDER BY AVG(i.freight_value)
    LIMIT 5
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT
        c.customer_state,
        AVG(i.freight_value) AS avg_freight,
        'high'::text AS type
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    JOIN order_items i ON o.order_id = i.order_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_state
    ORDER BY AVG(i.freight_value) DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
SELECT * 
FROM cte1
UNION ALL
SELECT * 
FROM cte2
ORDER BY type, avg_freight;
 

5.3) Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time.

with cte1 as(
select
	c.customer_state,
	round(avg(extract(day from (order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp))),2) as avg_delivery_time,
	'High'::text as type
from customers as c
join orders as o
on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
group by c.customer_state
order by avg(extract(day from (order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp))) desc
limit 5
),

cte2 as(
select
	c.customer_state,
	round(avg(extract(day from (order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp))),2) as avg_delivery_time,
	'Low'::text as type
from customers as c
join orders as o
on c.customer_id=o.customer_id
group by c.customer_state
order by avg(extract(day from (order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp)))
limit 5
)

select *
from cte1
union all
select *
from cte2
 

5.4) Find out the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery. You can use the difference between the averages of actual &  estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the delivery was for each state.

select 
	c.customer_state,
	round(avg(extract(day from (o.order_estimated_delivery_date - o.order_purchase_timestamp))),2)
	-(select round(avg(extract(day from (order_estimated_delivery_date - order_purchase_timestamp))),2) from orders)
	as avg_days_earlier
from customers as c
join orders as o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
group by c.customer_state
order by round(avg(extract(day from (o.order_estimated_delivery_date - o.order_purchase_timestamp))),2)
	-(select round(avg(extract(day from (order_estimated_delivery_date - order_purchase_timestamp))),2) from orders) desc
limit 5
 

6) Analysis based on the payments.

6.1) Find the month on month no. of orders placed using different payment types.

select 
	extract(year from order_purchase_timestamp) as year,
	extract(month from order_purchase_timestamp) as month,
	payment_type,
	count(distinct p.order_id) as total
from orders as o
join payments as p
on o.order_id = p.order_id
group by extract(year from order_purchase_timestamp),
		extract(month from order_purchase_timestamp),
		payment_type
 

6.2) Find the no. of orders placed on the basis of the payment installments that have been paid.

select
	payment_installments,
	count(distinct order_id) as total_orders
from payments
where payment_installments>1
group by payment_installments
